# labelHelper
Help create label for sample with yolo
This script can help you label a large sample size with a model trained on a small amount of data. 
For example: You mark up a small part of the sample, after which you train the neural network and using this script you can roughly mark up a large sample, 
then check this markup and train the sample on a large amount of data. 
Works when using YOLO.
